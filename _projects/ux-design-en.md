description: With a team of 6 people, we were tasked with creating a website on the theme of UX design tools and methods. The goal of this site was initially to familiarize ourselves with user experience and user interface design. It was also to create a site that adheres to accessibility standards. Over a period of two weeks, we were able to use numerous methods and tools to conduct user research and produce a site that meets the needs of our target audience.
