description: "L’évadé is a project carried out in collaboration with the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Bordeaux as part of an exhibition of interactive stories blending art & dreams. You play as a character waking up in utter confusion in front of a torn painting. A depiction of a crime whose perpetrator has escaped. You set out to question the characters in the neighboring paintings to discover one thing and one thing only: the truth. Will you be able to uncover what happened? The identity of the killer? Or even better, where they are?"
