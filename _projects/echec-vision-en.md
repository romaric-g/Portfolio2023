description: The goal of this project was to develop a system capable of detecting the movements of chess pieces on a real board and transcribing them onto a virtual interface. By using computer vision techniques such as object detection and motion tracking, I was able to create a system that allows players to play chess in a traditional manner while benefiting from the advantages offered by technology.
